# TimeComplexityFib

This is an exercise used for week 6 of Class Encore for CIS 212:

The goal was to write a program to print the nth Fibonacci number. The first solution does so recursively and has exponential time complexity. The second solution solves the recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), in order to achieve log(n) complexity (due to the power function having O(log(n)) complexity).

There is a C file that acts as a solution to the question posed to the group.

There is also a Jupyter notebook that compares the execution times using a visualization. The goal of this file is to further help students understand the importance of time complexity in writing good programs.
